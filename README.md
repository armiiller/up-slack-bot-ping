#Ping Slack Bot

This is an ultra simple slack bot that checks how long it takes a website to respond.

It is meant to run serverless using AWS [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). I use [Up](https://github.com/apex/up) to make my life easier.
